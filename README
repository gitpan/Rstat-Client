This is the README file for Rstat::Client


INTRODUCTION

    Rstat::Client is a tiny Perl package that provides client access
    to rstatd(8) statistics for UNIX servers. Connections to rstatd
    servers are Perl objects, so you may collect statistical data from
    multiple servers from within one Perl script.

    Using Rstat::Client is as simple as:

    use Rstat::Client;
    $clnt  = Rstat::Client->new('some.host');
    $stats = $clnt->fetch();
    printf 'CPU Load @some.host: %.2f %.2f %.2f\n', @{$stats->{'avenrun'}};


PREREQUISITES

    Rstat::Client needs Perl5 and a decent C Compiler; rpcgen(1) and
    /usr/include/rpcsvc/rstat.x will be handy but are not required.


INSTALLATION

    Unpack the distribution archive and chdir into Rstat-Client-xxx.
    Then type the following commands:

    perl Makefile.pl
    make
    make test
    make install

    Make sure rstatd is running on localhost or 'make test' will fail.
