This is the README file for Rstat::Client

INTRODUCTION

    Rstat::Client is a Perll library that provides client access to
    rstatd(8) statistics for UNIX servers. Connections to rstatd
    servers are Perl objects, so you may collect statistical data from
    multiple servers from within one Perl script.

    Using Rstat::Client is as simple as:

      use Rstat::Client;

      $clnt  = Rstat::Client->new('some.host');
      $stats = $clnt->fetch();

      printf 'CPU Load @some.host: %.2f %.2f %.2f\n', @{$stats->{'avenrun'}};

PREREQUISITES

    Starting with version 2.0, Rstat::Client is implemented in pure
    Perl and has no specific prerequisites.

INSTALLATION

    Unpack the distribution archive and chdir into Rstat-Client-xxx.
    Then type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    Make sure rstatd is running on localhost or 'make test' will fail.

HISTORY

    Rstat::Client was originally written by Axel Schwenke
    <axel.schwenke@gmx.net>, and versions 1.2 and earlier bear the

    implementation, was never released outside of Morgan Stanley;
    version 2.2 was the first pure-Perl version released on CPAN.
